# kube-topo

Generate a net graph with relationships between your containers, when you have no idea what happens on your kube cluster.
This is a full wip, cannot guarantee that it's working for you, it's works for me tho.
The code is also pretty bad, but it's a poc.

How to run it:
`python topo.py -n namespace1 namespace2 namespace3`
